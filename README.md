# Model-tracking-with-MLflow-and-Kubeflow
Kubeflow is an open-source platform that makes it easy to deploy and manage machine learning workflows on Kubernetes. MLflow is another open-source platform that provides tools for tracking and managing machine learning experiments.

This is a sample MLOps workflow where, I will be setting up a Kubeflow cluster and integrating it with MLflow to track the experiments run on the cluster. I then used this setup to train and track the performance of a model on a dataset.
